## Introduction to Computer Vision
This course was an in-depth study of computer vision and image processing techniques without any inference of Machine/Deep Learning. It aimed to establish firm roots of understanding visual data and its nature when it interacts with various mathematical operations to result the desried effect (edge detection, foreground-background seperation, quantization, object detection and many more).

Highly intuitive and mathematical subject to challenge our human perception and think digitally when dealing with visual data.
