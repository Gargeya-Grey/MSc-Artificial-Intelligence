You will then practice implementing a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) problem. We will use Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (DEAP), a Python library for evolutionary computation in this lab.\n",

This process is supposed to prime the fittest individuals so they play a bigger role in the generation of the offspring.\n",

This process often involves the deletion of some individuals using a given criterion in order to keep the amount of individuals bellow a certain threshold.\n",
